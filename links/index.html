<h1>HTTP</h1>
<img src="b.png" align="left"><p>The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol in the Internet protocol suite model for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems.[1] HTTP is the foundation of data communication for the World Wide Web, where hypertext documents include hyperlinks to other resources that the user can easily access, for example by a mouse click or by tapping the screen in a web browser.</p> 
<p>
Basic Features
<br>
There are three basic features that make HTTP a simple but powerful protocol:
<ul>
<li>
    HTTP is connectionless: The HTTP client, i.e., a browser initiates an HTTP request and after a request is made, the client waits for the response. The server processes the request and sends a response back after which client disconnect the connection. So client and server knows about each other during current request and response only. Further requests are made on new connection like client and server are new to each other.</li>

    <li>HTTP is media independent: It means, any type of data can be sent by HTTP as long as both the client and the server know how to handle the data content. It is required for the client as well as the server to specify the content type using appropriate MIME-type.</li>
 
    <li>HTTP is stateless: As mentioned above, HTTP is connectionless and it is a direct result of HTTP being a stateless protocol. The server and client are aware of each other only during a current request. Afterwards, both of them forget about each other. Due to this nature of the protocol, neither the client nor the browser can retain information between different requests across the <a href="#web">web pages.</a>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Basic Architecture

The following diagram shows a very basic architecture of a web application and depicts where HTTP sits:</p>
<p>
The HTTP protocol is a request/response protocol based on the <a href="#client">client/server</a> based architecture where web browsers, robots and search engines, etc. act like HTTP clients, and the Web server acts as a server.
Client<br>

The HTTP client sends a request to the server in the form of a request method, URI, and protocol version, followed by a MIME-like message containing request modifiers, client information, and possible body content over a TCP/IP connection.
Server<br>

The HTTP server responds with a status line, including the message's protocol version and a success or error code, followed by a MIME-like message containing server information, entity meta information, and possible entity-body content.

<h1>Client/Server</h1>
<img src="c.png" align="left"><p>Client Server Architecture is a computing model in which the server hosts, delivers and manages most of the resources and services to be consumed by the client. This type of architecture has one or more client computers connected to a central server over a network or internet connection. This system shares computing resources. Client/server architecture is also known as a networking computing model or client/server network because all the requests and services are delivered over a network.</p> 
<p>
Client-server architecture is an architecture of a computer network in which many clients (remote processors) request and receive service from a centralized server (host computer). Client computers provide an interface to allow a computer user to request services of the server and to display the results the server returns. Servers wait for requests to arrive from clients and then respond to them. Ideally, a server provides a standardized transparent interface to clients so that clients need not be aware of the specifics of the system (i.e., the hardware and software) that is providing the service. Clients are often situated at workstations or on personal computers, while servers are located elsewhere on the network, usually on more powerful machines. This computing model is especially effective when clients and the server each have distinct tasks that they routinely perform. In hospital data processing, for example, a client computer can be running an application program for entering patient information while the server computer is running another program that manages the database in which the information is permanently stored. Many clients can access the server’s information simultaneously, and, at the same time, a client computer can perform other tasks, such as sending e-mail. Because both client and server computers are considered intelligent devices, the client-server model is completely different from the old “mainframe” model, in which a centralized mainframe computer performed all the tasks for its associated “dumb” terminals.

<p>
Characteristics of a Client-Server Architecture</p>
<ul>
    <li>Client and server machines need different amount of hardware and software resources.</li>
    <li>Client and server machines may belong to different vendors.</li>
    <li>Horizzontal scalability (increase of the client machines) and vertical scalability (migration to a more powerful server or to a multiserver solution)</li>
    <li>A client or server application interacts directly with a transport layer protocol to establish communication and to send or receive information.</li>
    <li>The transport protocol then uses lower layer protocols to send or receive individual messages. Thus, a computer needs a complete stack of protocols to run either a client or a server.</li>
    <li>A single server-class computer can offer multiple services at the same time; a separate server program is needed for each service.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Web Pages</h1>
<p>A web page or webpage is a document, commonly written in <a href="#html">HTML</a>, that is viewed in an Internet browser. A web page can be accessed by entering a URL address into a browser's address bar. A web page may contain text, graphics, and hyperlinks to other web pages and files.

A web page is often used to provide information to viewers, including pictures or videos to help illustrate important topics. A web page may also be used as a method to sell products or services to viewers. Multiple web pages make up a website, like our Computer Hope website.

When you click a link provided by a search engine, you are accessing a web page. The Internet consists of millions of web pages, with more being added every day.</p></div>

<h1>Hyper Text Markup Language</h1>
<p>
The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.

HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.[2] </p>
